  <h1>Good Visualization VS. Bad Visualization</h1>


<p id="intro">According to Cairo, a good infographic should be truthful,
  functional, beautiful, insightful and enlightening. After
  viewing the graphic, viewers’ islands of knowledge should
  be enlarged, and they tend to learn more based on known
  knowledge. Here are two visualizations I want to talk
  about, one is good and the other is a bad one. </p>

<p id="good">The good one I want to talk about is about Napoleon’s
  march from France to Russia. The horizontal axe represents
   the progress of the army. The red bonds represent the
   size of the attack army and the black bonds represent
   the size of the retreat army. I want to analyze according
    to Cairo’s guideline of a good visualization. First of
    all, if it is truthful? There is a short paragraph at
    the top of the diagram, which illustrates where the
    information comes from and also explains the simplification
    the designer used. It provides detailed information about
    the sources of the information. And all of the information
    can be searched by ourselves. Thus, we can say that at least
    the diagram is truthful. Secondly, if it is functional? This
    diagram is pretty clear, it includes many details, like the
    temperature of that particular day, and the routes of the army.
    For ordinary people, this may not be very helpful, but it is really
    helpful for people who want to study that period of history and this
    diagram gives them an outline of Napoleon’ s march. Thirdly, if it is
    beautiful? At least from my point of view, it is beautiful. Most historical
    diagrams like this just have simple lines on existed maps, which is quite
    simple but also not attractive. For this diagram, it has color contrast between
    attack and retreat, which is intriguing. Moreover, if it is insightful? Like I
    said before, most historical diagrams about routes of some historical events just
    have lines drawn on the maps which is quite difficult to see for most of times,
    the lines just mixed with other lines on the map. Finally, if it is enlightening?
    When Cairo says enlightening, he thinks that the diagram can help viewers learn
    about more knowledge and then based on the known knowledge, they tend to ask more
    questions. Keeping doing that, viewers’ islands of knowledge will be enlarged.
    This diagram works very well on that. According to it, we learn about specific
    knowledge of Napoleon’s march and after knowing that, we may want to know how
    he retreats, and we can also find that information on the diagram. After that,
    we begin to learn more about his army and march, it really enlarges the viewers’
    islands of knowledge. </p>

<p id="bad">The bad example I want to talk about is the 3D pie chart.
  It does not have any information about its source, we do
  not if it is truth or not. Because of its messy 3D shape,
  viewers cannot differentiate which segment that note corresponds
  to. They even cannot distinguish each note. Because of its terrible
  looking, viewers will not be attracted, so they will not read it
  carefully and get any useful information from that. If they cannot
  get any information, then they cannot get enlightenment from that,
  which is the main way for the viewers to enlarge their islands of knowledge.
  Because its messy looking, if viewers read some of the notes carefully
  but cannot differentiate the corresponding segment, they will get false
  knowledge and their islands will even falls short. </p>
